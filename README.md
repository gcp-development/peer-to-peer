# Peer To Peer (Work In Progress)

## Motivation

Peer to peer networks(P2P) is defined as the group of devices that are connected together to create a network. [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework. The example provided was done using the Rust implementation of the libp2p networking stack with a Kubernetes infrastructure. The purpose of this little demo is to show how to implement a p2p network with Kubernetes and libp2p.

This demo is composed by:

[p2p-app](https://github.com/gcp-development/peer-to-peer/tree/main/p2p-app) ,This projects is associate to the Rust application.

[p2p-setup](https://github.com/gcp-development/peer-to-peer/tree/main/p2p-setup) ,This projects is associate to the Kubernetes setup.
