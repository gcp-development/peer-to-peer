# Peer To Peer (Work In Progress)

## Motivation

Peer to peer networks(P2P) is defined as the group of devices that are connected together to create a network. (libp2p)[https://libp2p.io/] is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework. The example provided was done using the Rust implementation of the libp2p networking stack with a Kubernetes infrastructure. The propose of this little demo is to show how to implement a p2p network with Kubernetes and libp2p.

This demo is composed by:

(p2p-app)[https://github.com/gcp-development/peer-to-peer/tree/main/p2p-app], This projects is associate to the Rust application.

(p2p-setup)[https://github.com/gcp-development/peer-to-peer/tree/main/p2p-setup], This projects is associate to the Kubernetes setup.
