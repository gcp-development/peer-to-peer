### Peer To Peer(p2p)

Peer to peer networks(P2P) is defined as the group of devices that are connected together to create a network. [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework.

Two [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) were created to accommodate the p2p-app. Which is a Rust application using the [libp2p ping protocol](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/introduction/protocols/ping/) to test the connectivity and performance between these two Pods. For each Pod a [image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/) is created and deployed into the [container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) inside of the corresponding Pod.

Although libp2p was originally developed to work with [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), we want to use it to create p2p applications that have no relationship to IPFS at all.

In order to do that we need:
<ul>
 <li>A discovery service that are is able to find peers.
 <li>A register service that are is able store peers ids in a data structure.</li>
<ul>
 
Every node in the network is uniquely identified through its peer id. 

Each peer has an identifier, which is generated from its public key. The are two main implementations: mDNS and the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table. The Kademlia DHT is used to discover peers in the IPFS network. 

The libp2p have two interfaces Advertiser and Discoverer:
<ul>
 <li>The Advertiser offers services to the network.</li>
 <li>The Discoverer is able to find peers.</li>
</ul>

## libp2p

libp2p was designed around the philosophy of creating small components that are easy to understand and test. These components should also be able to be swapped in order to accommodate different technologies or scenarios and also make it feasible to upgrade them over time. (Microservices, anyone?!?)

## Architecture

The libp2p interface acts as a thin veneer over a multitude of subsystems that are required in order for peers to be able to communicate. The main areas where these subsystems fit are:
<ul>
  <li>Peer Routing - Mechanism to decide which peers to use for routing particular messages. This routing can be done recursively, iteratively or even in a broadcast/multicast mode.</li>
  <li>Swarm - Handles everything that touches the 'opening a stream' part of libp2p, from protocol muxing, stream muxing, NAT traversal and connection relaying, while being multi-transport.</li>
  <li>Distributed Record Store - A system to store and distribute records. Records are small entries used by other systems for signaling, establishing links, announcing peers or content, and so on. They have a similar role to DNS in the broader Internet.</li>
  <li>Discovery - Finding or identifying other peers in the network.</li>
</ul>
